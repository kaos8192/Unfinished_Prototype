	-README.txt
		-Properly labelled the two seperate sections of the README into
		 Terminal and GUI.
		-Split up information in Terminal section into two subsections:
			-Compile commands:
				-More explanation on each Makefile command.
			-./create commands:
				-Added "Help" section commands and explanations.
				-Added END command information.
				-Removed comment that SPLIT command doesn't work.
		-Cleaned up the Terminal section to make it much more readable.
	-test.cpp
		-Added first-boot message to help user understand what to do. This
		 includes the purpose of the program, HELP commands, and prompting 
		 the user for their input. No longer is it just a blank screen at 
		 runtime.
		-Added a "HELP" family of commands. These commands are used to help 
		 users who do not have the README opened to refer to Syntax or 
		 arguments. These commands include:
			-HELP: Will print out all help information all at once.
			-INPUT: Tells user what the valid inputs and operations are.
			-SYNTAX: Gives the user the correct, usable syntax for various
			 commands.
			-GLOSSARY: A glossary of definitions for the Gates, in case the
			 user never heard of them before, along with examples of input
			 and output.
		-SPLIT command now had proper error-handling of incorrect inputs.
		-Fixed a bug where SPLIT would give too many/too little outputs
		 for numbers greater than 10.
	-gates.cpp
		-Added helpText function, which prints information based on which
		 HELP command was typed into the Terminal.
	-Removed temp.h

	Added rudementary console, still underconstruction based on the console-demo from imgui.
	Created gui_console.cpp for it within the gui-master
	Still need comments and some testing, but the basic framework is their strimmed down for us to continue building.


23:05 -- 4/4/2020
	Changed comments in gates.h to match those given in gates.cpp. That said:
	Added comments to gates.cpp, as well, including:
		1: Function descriptions -- what exactly the function does or
		   returns.
		2: Comments that give more detail inside the functions, themselves.


19:52 -- 4/4/2020
	Added some QOL additions
	1: Invalid inputs (i.e. not a gate, true, or false) will invalidate the
	   entire input.
	2: All types of inputs for true and false (All Capital, One Capital)
	   are now valid inputs.
	3: Comments are now in test.cpp to explain what is happening.
